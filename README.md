There are also many helpful resources available online, such as forums and online communities, where you can ask questions and get help from experienced Rust developers.

## Using ChatGPT to create, update, and troubleshoot/debug the code
ChatGPT is a large language model trained by OpenAI that can generate code and write text based on a given prompt. It can be a useful tool for creating, updating, and troubleshooting/debugging code, especially in a new programming language like Rust. However, it is important to note that ChatGPT is an AI and may not always produce accurate or optimal code. It is always a good idea to review and test the code generated by ChatGPT before using it in a production environment.

## Limitations of using an AI to create code in a new programming language
Using an AI to create code in a new programming language can be a useful tool, but it is important to recognize its limitations. An AI may not always be able to understand the nuances of a programming language or generate code that is optimal or follows best practices. It is always a good idea to review and test the code generated by an AI before using it in a production environment.

## Even this writeup was created with an AI
Even this writeup was created with the help of an AI! It is a testament to the power of AI in helping us write and generate code, but it is important to always be mindful of its limitations and to review and test the output carefully before using it in a production environment.
